## Reason of Existance
I made this because I was bored in my free time, and I've always wanted to make my own little "Virtual Machine."
The plan is to make the entire system into a little game that you can just open whenever, explore, and unveil the mysteries hidden beneath the surface of The Machine.

But if that isn't your thing, then by all means, just explore to your heart's content; I've made a lot of different systems that work with each-other into a fairly recognizable windows-like operating system, *We Are Sure You Will Feel Right At Home*. <br/>

## Inspiration
I am a huge fan of the game _"OneShot."_ This project is heavily based on its  _"World Machine Edition."_ As such, references to the game may be made.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not played OneShot, it is recommended to play to avoid minor story spoilers.
> <br/>**Proceed at your own discretion.**

The systems displayed are heavily based on _OneShot World Machine Edition_'s in-game systems and windows with my own personal twist.

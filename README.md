## Reason of Existance
**"What brought you here?** <br/>
I heard that the previous Owner wanted to create their own custom Operating System. I don't know where they are now, maybe they discovered something they weren't supposed to. <br/>
They said this Project wasn't finished, and that it was supposed to turn into a little game, how foolish."

"Please enjoy your stay. The Systems here are old and may be slightly bUGgY, but they should be similar to what you are already used to, User, ***We Are Sure You Will Feel Right At Home***."

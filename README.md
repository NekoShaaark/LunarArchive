## Reason of Existance
I made this as a little dev showcase _- or portfolio -_ of all the creations I have willed into existance through the power of _`CODE`_!

## Inspiration
I am a huge fan of the game _"OneShot."_ This project is heavily based on its  _"World Machine Edition."_ As such, references to the game may be made.

> If you have not played OneShot, it is highly recommended to play to avoid minor story spoilers.
